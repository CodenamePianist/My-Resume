    </head>
    <body>
        <p>I grew up in Plano, TX, just outside of Dallas. At the age of 10 I started playing the piano and fell in love with it. I took top prizes in local festivals and went on to get degrees in piano performance.</p>
        <p>In 2018, I took a chance and started as a Quality Assurance Tester at Bottle Rocket. I had no idea such a job existed beforehand or that I would love it as much as I love the piano. I quickly took to it and gained the skills necessary to succeed. I worked with many clients, building amazing experiences that are still being used today.</p>
        <p>Now I'm learning something new to become a web developer. I'm hoping that the new skills I learn will take me far and open doors to new experiences and lessons for me.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, my hobbies include going to concerts, hanging out with friends, eating a good meal with family, or working out.</p>
